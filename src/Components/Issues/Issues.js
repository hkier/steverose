                I am running to retain my seat so as to continue the privilege of representing YOU - the community and keeping our district one of the best in the area through fiscal responsibility, sound policy decision-making and support for our students, programs and professionals.
                Some of the things I would like to see accomplished over the next 4 years include:
            </p>
            <ul className="List">

                <li className="List-item">
