            <p>
                Since joining the board in August 2017, I have worked very hard to support and improve our
                schools and community while upholding and living the mission of the school district "to
                serve the educational needs of the community inspiring all students to successfully contribute to the world."
                Some of my accomplishments include:
                </p>
